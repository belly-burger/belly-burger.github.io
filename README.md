Intro staging-belly-burger fork to belly-burger repo and we should keep in mind that when we create a PR it should be pointing to staging not in belly-burger.

How to Start

- Clone staging-belly-burger
  - git clone git@github.com:staging-belly-burger/staging-belly-burger.github.io.git
- Create a branch base on the ticket
  - e.g. git checkout -b fix-header-title
- After finalizing your code create a PR directly to your branch
  - e.g. git push origin fix-header-title
- Then create a Pull Request that points to your branch (fix-header-title) going to staging-belly-burger
- For the final touch ask someone to review your work
